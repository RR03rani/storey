hey i mam ritika.. i like to w=eat food
###ls -a--> to show thw hidd files

git init is iudes to intialize git in that folder
there is a statgaing area where u see what files u want to for next step and what are npot
i mean the working directary has to be sent to staging area

###git status-> is a command to check wheter it is staging statte or not and lot of things there where it is  what are the fikls added
and untracked file also showing

to add in staging area cmd->git add filename
---> git add . --> to add everythig in staging of that directory we use that command

now to go that file here chapter1 in version control we need to cmd->
git commit -m "complete chapter one"
here -m is very impoertnt this is the message is showing at everu save point go and serch on google swhat is a save point

to see what commit u done just type-> git log
a peerticular hash code come out eith time aand author 
that hash code for uniquely for perticular commit

commit mens something has to changed and we are ok with that and we commiyt witrh a new verion as we re ohk with that 
thats why we are sending it to stgaing area and for using thata staging area some files wh=chich we want nt to track
then we dont send it to that version and a nw  version got  created by command git commit -m "mesaage type here"
now ths message shown when we wtite commit log

now if we just messupwith our cuurent file that is chapter3 hetr and we want to recover
it back then we just need to write ------>git checkout filename ehich we want rooll back to last version
version changed when we commit it 
to check my changes and my last version just---->git diff filename

how to send local repostart to github

how to remote your local repositry to fit repositary-->
to do that i m going to use a command
--> git remote add origin and the path which shows on guithub

now remote is basically a conjuxtion for push pull in github and we shoud we cn say that
in easy language we create vatriable of remote whch name origin by vconvention we use 
that variable name a origin other wise we can take any

now to push in git hub reposiary we use
-----> git push -u origin master 
master ia a branch ame of origin where we push and -u is a flag which links up my remote and local
and master vranch is main branch for commiting your repositart

when we commit some version then it will become the master brancjh and we send to local repository to oremote repository
which m=is maintain by git hib in rdemote repositary and when we push in github then it goes all commit that is all chnages all version
to remote repositarty as all are present in the  master  branch



HOW TO DO NOT PUSH UP YOUR PROJECTS WITHOUT SENDING SECRETS FILE AN IN SECRET FILE USER PREFERSNCE UTILITY FILE API KEYS ANOTHER THINGS LIKE DS STORE FILE (HOW YOUR ICONS ARRANGED)
DS STORE IS HODDEN FILE


to undo forthe last step like if u add in stage so to undo from stage 
cmd use---->git rm --cached -r .

"." is usedfor  all files
-r is a flag


to checkout in your branch i mean to enter ur  branch

--->git checkout name of the branch

*.txt if we write in .gitignore file then it ignore all txt format file
and we haveto write specifically which file ignore like if we want to ignore a dile like
secret.txt then we have to write in the file .gitignore

in gitignore file # is used for commnet

cloning--
----------------------------------------------
CLONING

to move from remote repositoty to local repositarty

to clone we simply write

---->git clone and path u copiedof that file from github

==========================================================
MERGING AND BRANCHING IN GITHUB

to make branch in folder-->
git branch branchname

to show how many branch with name 
--->git branch
the * sign which branch are currently u r

to checkout any branch or to switch any branch
write ---->git chcekout name of the branch
