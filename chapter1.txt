hey i mam ritika.. i like to w=eat food
###ls -a--> to show thw hidd files

git init is iudes to intialize git in that folder
there is a statgaing area where u see what files u want to for next step and what are npot
i mean the working directary has to be sent to staging area

###git status-> is a command to check wheter it is staging statte or not and lot of things there where it is  what are the fikls added
and untracked file also showing

to add in staging area cmd->git add filename
---> git add . --> to add everythig in staging of that directory we use that command

now to go that file here chapter1 in version control we need to cmd->
git commit -m "complete chapter one"
here -m is very impoertnt this is the message is showing at everu save point go and serch on google swhat is a save point

to see what commit u done just type-> git log
a peerticular hash code come out eith time aand author 
that hash code for uniquely for perticular commit

commit mens something has to changed and we are ok with that and we commiyt witrh a new verion as we re ohk with that 
thats why we are sending it to stgaing area and for using thata staging area some files wh=chich we want nt to track
then we dont send it to that version and a nw  version got  created by command git commit -m "mesaage type here"
now ths message shown when we wtite commit log

now if we just messupwith our cuurent file that is chapter3 hetr and we want to recover
it back then we just need to write ------>git checkout filename ehich we want rooll back to last version
version changed when we commit it 
to check my changes and my last version just---->git diff filename
